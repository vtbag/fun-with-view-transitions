# Fun with View Transition

This repo contains example to follow along with the _Fun with View Transitions_ [episodes](https://vtbag.dev/fwvt/welcome/) on vtbag.dev.

Don't try to run these examples in a Web-IDE like StacklBlitz, CodePen or Codespace when they require real cross-document navigation.
